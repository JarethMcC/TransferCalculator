# TransferCalculator
A program written in Python that reads from a text file to take stats from players in the game FIFA to calculate a price for them based on a weighting I created for them to value certain stats more importantly depending on the position.
Currently work in progress.
Fix Height was a small program I created to take the height stat and convert it from feet to centimetres.
